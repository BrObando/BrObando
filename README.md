I'm at the thrilling intersection of healthcare and technology, weaving my roots as a laboratory scientist into an exhilarating plunge into the world of software development. My journey? An exploration that stretches from test tubes to code.

My previous career gifted me valuable experiences, but I craved a new challenge, and the vibrant universe of software development called out to me. Through online courses, coding bootcamps, and countless hours of self-directed learning, I've not just gained proficiency but dived headfirst into various programming languages and development frameworks.

Each project has become my canvas for experimentation, a playground where I fearlessly try out new languages, frameworks, and methodologies. Whether mastering the intricacies of front-end development or plumbing the depths of back-end complexities, my arsenal now boasts a diverse range of skills. I'm fluent in languages and frameworks like JavaScript, Python, React, SQL, and Express. The proof? Responsive web applications that optimize database structures‚Äîeach project a testament to my commitment to delivering solutions that marry technical prowess with user-centric excellence.

Transitioning from a non-tech background to a proficient software developer? That's just the kickoff. I'm itching to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape, dreaming of a future brimming with innovative projects, collaborative ventures, and an unyielding thirst for knowledge.
